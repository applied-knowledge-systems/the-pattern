# The Pattern's purpose: 

Collaboration platform to demonstrate how modern technologies can help solve domain specific problems leveraging knowledge of the community (medical through UMLS in the first instance) 

# The Pattern's current capabilities:

* Semantic search
- Including knowledge graph build by term to concept mapping
* Adaptive relevance based on user feedback
* Text summarization (GoogleT5 model)
* Domain-specific Question/Answer (semantic search/graph search + BERT QA)
* Real-time or near real time data processing
- backend response time ms or ns, because it's all powered by Redis
can be extended to reccommenders and other use cases
