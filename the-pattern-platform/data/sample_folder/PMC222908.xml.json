            "text": "Since November 2002 (and perhaps earlier) an outbreak of a very contagious atypical pneumonia (now named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) initiated in the Guangdong Province of China. This outbreak started a world-wide epidemic after a medical doctor from Guangzhou infected several persons at an hotel in Kowloon around February 21st, 2003 (SAR Hong Kong, China). Although apparently classical in its onset, the pattern of the outbreak became puzzling after an estate in Hong Kong was affected, with a huge number of patients infected by the virus apparently causing the disease. In particular it appeared that underlying this highly focused outbreak there remained a more or less constant background infection level, that remained present in Guangdong for a long time and witnessed a slow decline in Hong Kong, on which superimposes sudden local outbreaks. This pattern is difficult to reconcile with a standard epidemic pattern for reasons that have to be analyzed. Many hypotheses can be put forward to account for this observation. Learning from a set of coronavirus mediated epidemics that affected pigs in the 1983 \u20131985 [1] we chose to explore here the consequences of a situation where two overlapping epidemics interfere with each other. The hypothesis of the double epidemic model for SARS we develop here is as follow. It is based on the high mutation and recombination rate of coronaviruses [2], and on the observation that tissue tropism can be changed by simple mutations [3]. There are two epidemics, one epidemic is SARS caused by a coronavirus virus, call it virus A. Another epidemic, which may have appeared before SARS, is assumed to be extremely contagious because of the nature of the virus and of its relative innocuousness, could be propagated by contaminated food and soiled surfaces. It could be caused by some coronavirus, call it virus B. The most likely is that it would cause gastro-enteritis (this fits with the observation that many people had diarrhoea for about one day, during this winter in Guangdong and in Hong Kong). The most likely origin of virus A is a more or less complicated mutation or recombination event from virus B [4-6]. We also explore the possible situation where viruses A and B would be of totally different origin, but would cause an overlapping immune response of the host. Both epidemics would spread in parallel, and it can be expected that the epidemic caused by virus B which is rather innocuous, protects against SARS (so that na\u00efve regions, not protected by the epidemic B can get SARS large outbreaks). Various consequences of the spreading pattern of this double epidemic hypothesis are discussed in relation with the puzzling distribution of the disease in Mainland China, noticeably, in the huge difference witnessed between the situation in Beijing and in Shanghai (both regions have tight and frequent contacts with Guangdong and Hong Kong). As a side prediction of the model we can infer conclusions on the accuracy of available epidemiological data.",

The spread of SARS in Hong Kong started on February 21, 2003, when a doctor from Guangdong province traveled to Hong Kong to visit his family and stayed in a local hotel. He had become unwell a few days earlier and was now seriously ill. He was admitted to a hospital on February 22 and died shortly after. By the time he died, he had infected 10 guests who had been staying at the same hotel. These individuals were subsequently responsible for major outbreaks in hospitals in Hong Kong and the Amoy Gardens, a housing estate in Hong Kong.",

The daily number of SARS cases are grouped into three categories: i) the Amoy Gardens, ii) the community, iii) the hospital staff. The graph can be considered as an approximation of . The graph has several peaks and it therefore looks very different from the general shape of the graph of the function I. In the SIR model once the I curve decreases, it will decrease to the zero value Therefore, the standard SIR model could not be used to model the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. If we take away those cases from the hospital staff and the Amoy Gardens Estate, that is if we only consider the cases from the community, then the graph looks closer to the general shape of a graph for a function I. However, it is still difficult for a general SIR model to produce a I curve whose values are within a narrow range (say 15 to 25 cases) for a relatively long time interval. This motivated us to replace the SIR model by the SEIR model. In this model there is a fixed period between exposure and becoming infectious, called latent period (this is in fact the case for SARS and it is another reason why we consider the SEIR model). Thus, rather than an exposed susceptible becoming immediately infectious, it enters the Exposed class, labeled E, remaining there a fixed period of time. More detailed description of this model will be given in the next section. It is worth mentioning here that the SEIR model can produce much more interesting and complicated I, R and  curves. It is also possible to produce a I curve whose values are within a narrow range for a relatively long time interval and result thus in a relatively large R\u221e. Note that the SIR model is the limiting case of the SEIR model when the time interval from the infection to onset is zero; for given parameters r and a the total size of the epidemic is the same in the two models; however the duration is longer for the SEIR model which will display lower admission per day curves (or the I curves); if we see this result from the reciprocal point of view, the same level of admissions per day will result in a higher total epidemic size for the SEIR model than for the SIR model because of the Exposed class which is \"hidden\" in the sense that it has no effects on the other classes until the individuals move to the Infective class and thus contributing to the propagation of the epidemic. A numerical illustration of this phenomena is given in Figure 3 that plots the evolution of the S,E, I and R classes for the two models with the same parameters r and a.",

            "text": "The parameters estimations are very crucial when one applies the SIR models. When the initial population of the susceptibles is very large, a small change in the parameters can result in a large difference in the values of R\u221e. For example, if we take the total initial population, S(0) = 6.8 millions (e.g. the case of Hong Kong) and an initial infected class of I(0) = 10 persons, together with a = 2/3 and r = 9.788 \u00d7 10-8, then R\u221e is about 5,000. Suppose we increase the r parameter by 1% to have r = 9.88588 \u00d7 10-8, then R\u221e will become 116464. This sensitivity in the parameters can therefore give rise to unacceptable errors in predicting the size of the epidemic and invalidates thus the model. Contrariwise, when we try to fit the data with respect to a hypothetical much smaller population, the sensitivity decreases. Therefore, we are lead to consider a model for which the effective population, i.e. the total population that enters the susceptible class is, for some yet to define reason, much less than the total population. In other words, a large portion of the total population is protected during the epidemic. Note that this happens when a population undergoes vaccination against a disease, i.e. some people become not only immune to the epidemic but do not transmit it neither. It is also possible that the vaccination against another disease can protect people from being infected by SARS. Another possibility is that a different, but similar, disease that spread before (or is spreading simultaneously with SARS) has immunized some of the population against SARS; this is our working hypothesis because it fits better with the relatively surprising SARS propagation which is less severe in places with low hygiene conditions. Based on this hypothesis, we shall develop a double epidemic model, the SEIRP model to study the outbreak of SARS in the next section.",

Secondly, since we only want to study phenomena that immunize people from the initial S class, the details of the (SIR or SEIR-like) spread of the protective disease B are less important that those of the propagation of the epidemic A.

In this context, mathematical models can have several functions. They may be phenomenological and descriptive, to predict the immediate future [7]. They may also propose hypotheses and explore their consequences in order to provide political and medical authorities with orientations that may help them to take decisions, at a time when a situation is rapidly evolving. The model we explore here is meant to that purpose. We started to try to account for the data collected on the disease using the standard epidemiological model, the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemic model [12,13,17]. As shown in the first section of our work, data do not fit with the model. In particular, the long \"tail\" of the number of cases that appears to be trailing for a long time cannot be easily accounted for in this framework. In addition there are huge discrepancies, within the same country, and with people who are highly connected both in terms of travelling and communication, and in genetic background, between the number of cases, as illustrated by the difference between the number of SARS cases in Beijing (in thousands) and in Shanghai (in tens at most). Of course one obvious explanation might be a difference in reporting cases (see below), but this looks unlikely in these two cities which are so tightly connected to the rest of the world that it would be difficult to hide such a severe disease.",

            "text": "In a situation where the accuracy of data is disputable, it would be counterproductive (and even unscientific) to try to incorporate the many fine details of causes of an epidemic. It is important to extract an outline of what is happening with models that are progressively made more complex, in order to extract the relevant parameters and try to draw conclusions on the many possible causes and controls of epidemics. When finding that the SIR model could not account for the available data we faced many possibilities based on virus behavior, population dynamics, technical difficulties in identifying the disease (many atypical to the respiratory tract. We explored two major situations. One when the epidemics pneumonia types exist) and socio-political constraints that cast significant doubt on the accuracy of data collection. Knowing the nature of the virus that causes SARS [14], a coronavirus, we chose here to start by exploring the consequences of a situation that prevailed twenty years ago in the population of pigs in Europe [10,15], where a virus and its variant caused a double epidemic when it changed its tropism from the small intestine are subsequent to each other, in a way allowing the first one to provide some protection to part of the exposed population. This situation is not fundamentally different from the situation explored by the SIR model. It may account for places with a large population and a low level of prevalence. In contrast, a second situation where both epidemics overlap, the first one being highly contagious and under no control because it is understood as a mild frequent ailment and the second one causing SARS, will give rise to patterns that appear to be similar to what is observed in places such as Hong Kong and the Guangdong province. It is worth stressing that we did not explore the intricacies of the mathematical solutions of this new epidemiological model, but, rather, tried to test with very crude hypotheses whether a new mode of transmission might not account for surprising aspects of some epidemics. The central reason for our approach is that the more parameters introduced, the easier it is to represent any type of reality (this was the basis of the epicycle representation of the movement of planets in the Ptolemean system). Because data may be inaccurate (and at the time of writing this is a major concern for the WHO authorities) it is convenient to smooth them out. This is convenient in a continuous model represented by a set of simple differential equations. A drawback of this approach appears when the number of cases becomes small: a discrete model involving stochastic parameters would be more adapted. However this would probably require even more accuracy in the data, a feat that is impossible to achieve. A second constraint introduced by inaccuracy in the data set is that the behavior of the epidemic is so complex that it would require many parameters to be represented, implying, in fact that a very large set of causes would account for the observations. We tried to overcome these difficulties by restricting as much as possible the number of fitting parameters in the model. Furthermore we checked that the parameters we introduced were consistent with a purely phenomenological description of the disease. In fact, from the work of Donnelly C. et al. [18] on the statistics about the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong, the incubation period plus the time from onset to admission is about 10.12 days. On the other hand, the incubation period plus the time from onset to admission is about 1/a + 1/b days and from our parameters estimations on a and b, we find that 1/a + 1/b is about 11.8 and 11.4 for two different scenarios. With these constraints we were able to simulate the epidemic at several places (Hong Kong, Beijing, Inner Mongolia) while other places failed to be represented faithfully (for instance for the Guangdong region where the size of the epidemic \u2013 with only 2 or 3 new cases for some days \u2013 is too small when compared with the total population of over 80 millions : in this case either the data does not reflect the real situation or the differential model is not relevant for this setting). Furthermore we could use the set of parameters measured from the past unfolding of the epidemic, to construct scenarios for its future trends and monitor the impact of political decisions to control its spread and development.",

Indeed, we noticed that due to the imprecision inherent in the data many sets of parameters display good fit with the observed time series; however the difference of behaviour between e.g. the final size of the epidemic as given by this simulations is sometimes important (error bars too large) and cannot be reliably asserted in the absence of further investigations. However some qualitative properties of the dynamics of the system under consideration can prove to be important when analysing this epidemic. For instance one important problem is the question of whether the epidemic is under control or not. Contrary to the standard SIR model where this question has a simple answer, here we cannot say that the epidemic is under control when the number of admission per day decreases; indeed in the SEIR models, it may happen that momentarily the number of people in the Infective class is low while the Exposed class is still high (they have not yet been infectious); thus the epidemic may seem stopped but will then be out of control again when in people in the Exposed class migrate to the Infected class and will start contaminating other people (especially if sanitary security policy has been relaxed). Thus an effective policy necessarily takes into account the time required for the Exposed (E) class to become infectious and will require zero new cases during all the period. The double epidemic can have a flat, extended peak and short tail compared to a single epidemic, and it may have more than one peak because of the latency so that claims of success may be premature.",

A second, perhaps more comforting consequence is that it suggests that a vaccine will be possible: indeed, in our model one form of the virus (or, alternatively, other viruses displaying cross immunity) is protecting against SARS. This is typically what is expected from a vaccine and this is perhaps what is witnessed with the apparent low infection rate or, at least mild infection, in children and young adults (an observation that needs to be fully documented). We should however remain cautious, since vaccination against coronaviruses is not always straightforward [16]. If our model is right, then it is likely that virus B gave several different types of A variants, causing SARS with a variety of virulence. This may also account for some of the variability observed at different places. This might be substantiated by sequencing CoV genomes isolated from many patients. If this were true, then the reservoir might be much larger than suspected and SARS may happen again when the weather cools down in autumn. Our model would then be useful to enforce proper precautionary measures immediately.",

This indicates that the simple model of contagion by a single stable virus does not hold. The second conclusion is that, at least in some regions, data may be inaccurate to account for the reality of the epidemic. This is true in various parts of mainland China and can be accounted for by the large variation in SARS symptoms, and perhaps in provinces next to Beijing, by underreporting. Finally, this study sends a message of hope: lack of fitting of predicted curves with actual recent data indicate that the containment measures decided by the WHO and relayed by governments are effective. Furthermore, this model, that assumes that a mild epidemic protects against SARS would predict that a vaccine is possible, and may soon be created. It also suggests that there might exist a SARS precursor in a large reservoir, prompting for implementation of precautionary measures when the weather cools down.",
