The overall picture presented confirms that the incidence has tripled but the mortality rate has fallen from 28% to 18% over the 22 years. The proportion of patients with any organ failure increased from 19% to 34%, whereas the average hospital stay fell from 17 to 12 days. White females appear to be the least vulnerable group. Given the study methodology and complexities surrounding the definition of sepsis, drawing detailed conclusions is problematic, but this study undoubtedly provides further evidence to support the enormous ongoing efforts to tackle this phenomenon.",

The large population studied was North American, with a median intensive care unit (ICU) stay of only 2 days. Fifty-six per cent of patients admitted to ICU were overweight (30%), obese (20%) or severely obese (6%). Unsurprisingly, the investigators found that being underweight (13%) was associated with excess mortality, but the overweight/obese/severely obese appeared to fair no worse than their normal (33%) compatriots. The overweight/obese/severely obese did, however, have longer durations of ICU and hospital stay, but had no excess functional disability at hospital discharge. Thus, a high body mass index appears not to predict short-term outcome but places additional burdens on health care resources.",

In the majority of patients, whose response time was more than 5 min, this intervention significantly improved the chances of the individual surviving to 1 year (13/64 [20%] versus 2/55 [4%]). This goes against the dogma of immediate defibrillation and is supported by previous work, as discussed in the accompanying editorial [8]. The authors suggest that the key issue then becomes rapidly establishing the duration of ventricular fibrillation, in order to establish which patients might benefit from this approach. However, because no advantage was established for defibrillation prior to 3 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, shouldn't all out-of-hospital arrests receive this manoeuvre?",

Keh and colleagues [9] conducted a detailed cross-over trial to investigate this further. Giving hydrocortisone as a continuous infusion (240\u2013300 mg/day), they demonstrated the now well recognized haemodynamic benefits. They established that steroids at this dose in patients with septic shock lead to downregulation of both the pro- and anti-inflammatory cascades, while enhancing neutrophil phagocytosis and monocyte function. The cross-over design resulted in rapid withdrawal of steroids after 72 hours, which caused negative rebound effects both in haemodynamic and inflammatory/immunological parameters. The study provides evidence of an additional beneficial role that steroids at this dose may play in patients with septic shock \u2013 that of immune enhancement and inflammatory modulation. Many questions remain regarding the optimal use of this simple and arguably physiological intervention, but the sceptics would appear to have received a further blow.",

Animal and human evidence to support the hypothesis that ventilator-induced lung injury causes distant organ damage through the pulmonary production of apoptosis-inducing soluble mediators is provided by an elegant set of experiments conducted by Imai and coworkers [10], who reduced this effect by employing a lung protective strategy. Gerlach and colleagues [11] have again demonstrated no benefit from inhaled nitric oxide in adults with ARDS in a small randomized controlled trial of 40 patients. They also established that efficacy, in terms of improvement in arterial oxygen tension/fractional inspired oxygen ratio, and dose response are both attenuated by continuous administration, whereas these are maintained in control patients. Surely this study, if not the body of evidence that precedes it, should sound the death knell of inhaled nitric oxide in ARDS. Finally, an old fashioned intervention received a further vote for resurrection. Cyclical sighs are a recruitment manoeuvre that has received little attention in recent years. Pelosi and colleagues have added to their previous work in this area [12] with a study investigating the efficacy of sign recruitment in supine and prone positioning [13]. They demonstrated the potential value of the combination of sigh ventilation and prone positioning in 10 ARDS patients, and added to the body of evidence that supports further investigation of this theoretically attractive strategy. The only caveat is that today no intervention that improves oxygenation in ARDS has been shown to lead to an outcome benefit.",
